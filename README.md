By running app.R you can see the dashboard. \
My dashboard fetches the data from Yahoo finance API. \
You can select the date range, you want to visualize. Can choose frequency, data type. \
There is also an option to write ticker values. Examples for tickers - AA, AAP, AAPL, SPY and many more. \
The plot which you see does not display the actual value, in fact it shows you the value change with respect to the starting date. \
In the table you can see the absolute values of past 6 days.
